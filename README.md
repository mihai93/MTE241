# MTE241
Introduction to Computer Structures and Real-time Systems

Hi. You've ventured this far I might as well let you know what you're looking at.

In MTE241 we were required to develop on a Keil MCB1700 evaluation board using real-time OS theory.

## Project 2


## Project 3
Implementing quicksort in C-programming language.

### Requirements
- use task creation and destruction to solve a problem using parallel computation,
- use the UART, and
- use busy waiting as the means of synchronization.
- use semaphores as the means of synchronization.

## Project 4
Creating a game involving moving balls.

### Requirements
- use interrupt handling routines to intercept signals from peripherals,
- use the general-purpose input/output (GPIO),
- show output using the LEDs, and
- show output using the LCD screen.
